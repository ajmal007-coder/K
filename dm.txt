b. The institutional arrangement for disaster management in India is structured at multiple levels:

1. National Level

National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA): The apex body established in 2005, responsible for policy formulation and coordination of disaster management efforts.

Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA): Oversees implementation of the Disaster Management Act and coordinates with states.


2. State Level

State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMAs): Each state has an SDMA to implement disaster management policies and coordinate with local bodies.


3. District and Local Levels

District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs): Implement disaster management plans at the district level, coordinating response and recovery efforts.

Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs): Local governance bodies engage in community preparedness and response initiatives.


Other Stakeholders

NGOs and Private Sector: NGOs provide support and training, while businesses contribute to disaster management efforts.


This multi-tiered arrangement promotes an integrated approach to enhance preparedness, response, and resilience across India.
